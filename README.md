# Portfolio

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio. This site is designed to present to you, future employer, with a demonstration of projects I've completed. The projects displayed are the culmination of a lot of learning over a short period of time. Each project shows demonstrated proficiency in:

- HTML5/CSS
- Javascript/jQuery
- CSS Frameworks
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Databases (ie MySQL and MongoDB)
- HTML Scraping
- Handlebars
- React.js

This portfolio was created utilizing Handlebars, Tailwind CSS Framework, Express, and Sequelize. To view my projects, click on the Portfolio link at the top of the page. Each listed project will contain links to the associated app, GitHub repository, and a description of what the project does. I still consider this portfolio to be a work in progress as I want to make the Submit Project link (also at the top) only available to me. I plan to utilize Passport for this.

Please take your time to explore the site and listed projects. Feel free to contact me using any of the methods listed at the bottom of the page. I truly look forward to discussing with you how I can postively contribute to your company. Thank you.
